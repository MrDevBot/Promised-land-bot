## Reaction Role System

User Invocation for: 
1 | /reactrole messageId IsRoleRestricted Mode :reaction1: roleId1
2 | /reactrole messageId IsRoleRestricted Mode :reaction1: roleId1 :reaction2: roleId2
3 | /reactrole messageId IsRoleRestricted Mode :reaction1: roleId1 :reaction2: roleId2 :reaction3: roleId3
4 | /reactrole messageId IsRoleRestricted Mode :reaction1: roleId1 :reaction2: roleId2 :reaction3: roleId3 :reaction4: roleId4

Logic: 

If IsRoleRestricted = True:
 - Ask for role in next message (or "no" to cancel) in next message from invoker.
 
Make Config File with Data from invoker command.
Add Reactions to message referenced. 
Store reference of reaction role config in log.

END



When a user reacts to a message:
- Check log for if the message is a ReactRole message
- If Role Restricted and User doesn't have role: Remove Reaction and inform user via DMs.
- Check which reaction they have reacted with.
- Get RoleId referred to.
- If Mode == 0: Toggle Role to User (if they don't have it, add it. If they do have it, remove it)
- If Mode == 1: Add Role to User if they don't have it.
- If Mode == 2: Remove Role from User if they have it.
